# Fonts-Downloader
I made this program just for exercising.
The program loads all google fonts through an api call.
After choosing a font, all styles and sizes will be loaded.
Choose the sizes and the style you want to download.
By clicking downlaod the program will download all fonts file and will create css file and all fonts will be linked in css file.
To use the program you need a google fonts api key
